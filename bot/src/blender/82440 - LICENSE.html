All dices are manifold, and thereby ready for print. They are also grouped so that certain dice/dices can be linked or appended in other projects. There are Vertex Groups for numbers/dots and for "all but numbers/dots". All dices have white Vertex Colour with black numbers/dots, so that different materials can be applied. The dices are:1 x D20 (alphanumerical)1 x D12 (alphanumerical)2 x D10 (1 ordinary alphanumerical, 1 Percentile alphanumerical)1 x D8 (alphanumerical)2 x D6 (1 dotted, 1 alphanumerical)1 x D4 (alphanumerical)If you find this useful, I would appreciate a screenshot in the comments below.
