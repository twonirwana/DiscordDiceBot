This bot is for rolling dice in discord.
The bot needs to be configured with a slash command in a channel and then provides a message with buttons.
Upon clicking on a button the bot will roll the stored dice expression for the button, post the result and move the
message with the buttons to the bottom of the channel.
If the message is pined, then it will only be copied and not moved.
This allows user to roll dice without typing commands and thereby improves usability, especially for touchscreen users.
The bot supports Discord thread (the button message must be added after the thread creation), forum, Text in Voice, and
it is possible to send the answer in a different channel.
It can provide images of the dice roll results and it is possible to configure channel or user specific aliases.

*The bot need the following permission*:

* create application commands (which are needed to control the bot)
* send message and send message in threads (for the dice buttons and results)
* embed links (display of structured answers)
* attach files (add images with the dice result)
* read message history (to detect if a button message was pinned)
